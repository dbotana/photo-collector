1. **Log into AWS Console**: https://aws.amazon.com/console/
2. **Navigate to S3**: Services → Storage → S3
3. **Create Bucket**:
   - Click "Create bucket"
   - **Bucket name**: Choose a globally unique name (e.g., `my-photo-collector-2024`)
   - **Region**: Select your preferred region (e.g., `us-east-1`)
   - **Block Public Access**: Keep default settings (recommended)
   - Click "Create bucket"

### Step 2: Configure CORS Policy

S3 buckets need CORS configuration to allow web uploads:

1. **Select your bucket** → **Permissions** tab
2. **Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)** section
3. **Click "Edit"** and paste this configuration:

```json
[
    {
        "AllowedHeaders": [
            "*"
        ],
        "AllowedMethods": [
            "PUT",
            "POST"
        ],
        "AllowedOrigins": [
            "*"
        ],
        "ExposeHeaders": [
            "ETag"
        ]
    }
]
```

4. **Click "Save changes"**

### Step 3: Create IAM User

Create a dedicated user with limited S3 permissions:

1. **Navigate to IAM**: Services → Security → IAM
2. **Users** → **Add users**
3. **User details**:
   - **User name**: `photo-collector-user`
   - **Select AWS credential type**: Access key - Programmatic access
4. **Set permissions**: Attach existing policies directly
5. **Create policy** (if needed):

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:PutObjectAcl"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:HeadBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR-BUCKET-NAME"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Replace `YOUR-BUCKET-NAME`** with your actual bucket name.

6. **Review and create user**
7. **Save the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key** (you won't see them again!)

### Step 4: Configure App Settings

In the Photo Collector app:

1. **Click "S3 Configuration"** to expand settings
2. **Enter your details**:
   - **S3 Bucket Name**: Your bucket name (e.g., `my-photo-collector-2024`)

**Mac/Linux**:
```bash
ifconfig | grep inet
```
Look for your local IP (usually starts with `192.168.` or `10.`)

#### 2. Start Server with Network Binding

```bash
cd photo-collector

# Windows
python -m http.server 8000 --bind 0.0.0.0

# Mac/Linux
python3 -m http.server 8000 --bind 0.0.0.0
```

#### 3. Access from iPhone

1. **Connect iPhone to same WiFi network** as your computer
2. **Open Safari on iPhone**
3. **Navigate to**: `http://YOUR-IP-ADDRESS:8000`
   - Example: `http://192.168.1.100:8000`
4. **Allow camera access** when prompted
5. **Add to Home Screen** (optional): Safari menu → "Add to Home Screen"

### Method 2: HTTPS for Production Testing

For full camera functionality, iPhone requires HTTPS:

#### Option A: Using ngrok (Easy)

1. **Install ngrok**: https://ngrok.com/download
2. **Start your local server**:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
3. **In another terminal**:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 8000
   ```
4. **Use the HTTPS URL** provided by ngrok (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io`)

#### Option B: Self-Signed Certificate

1. **Generate certificate**:
   ```bash
   # Create self-signed certificate
   openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes
   ```

2. **Start HTTPS server**:
   ```python
   # https_server.py
   import http.server
   import ssl
   import socketserver

   PORT = 8443
   Handler = http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler

   with socketserver.TCPServer(("", PORT), Handler) as httpd:
       httpd.socket = ssl.wrap_socket(httpd.socket,
                                    certfile='./cert.pem',
                                    keyfile='./key.pem',
                                    server_side=True)
       print(f"HTTPS Server at https://localhost:{PORT}")
       httpd.serve_forever()
   ```

3. **Run**: `python https_server.py`
4. **Access**: `https://YOUR-IP:8443` (accept security warning)

**Problem**: "Camera not supported"
- **Solution**: Use Safari browser (Chrome/Firefox have limitations)
- **Check**: iOS version (requires iOS 11+)

### S3 Upload Issues

**Problem**: "Access Denied" error
- **Check**: IAM policy includes both bucket and object permissions
- **Verify**: Bucket name matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- **Test**: Try uploading a small test file first

**Problem**: CORS errors in browser console
- **Solution**: Verify CORS policy is saved correctly
- **Check**: AllowedOrigins includes "*" or your specific domain
- **Wait**: CORS changes may take a few minutes to propagate

**Problem**: "Invalid Access Key" error
- **Check**: No extra spaces in Access Key ID or Secret Key
- **Verify**: Keys are from the correct IAM user
- **Test**: Keys work in AWS CLI: `aws s3 ls s3://your-bucket-name`

### Network/Connectivity Issues

**Problem**: Can't access from iPhone
- **Check**: Both devices on same WiFi network
- **Verify**: Computer firewall allows incoming connections on port 8000
- **Test**: Try accessing from another device first

**Problem**: Slow uploads
- **Solution**: Use WiFi instead of cellular data
- **Check**: Image size (app compresses to ~80% quality)
- **Consider**: Upload during off-peak hours
