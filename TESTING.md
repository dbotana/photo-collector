## 📱 Manual Testing Procedures

### Camera Functionality
1. **Grant Permissions**: Allow camera access when prompted
2. **Test Capture**:
   - Click "Take Photo" → Video stream appears
   - Click capture button → Photo captured and previewed
   - Verify preview image quality
3. **Error Scenarios**:
   - Deny camera permissions
   - Camera already in use
   - No camera available

### File Upload Testing
1. **Valid Files**: Test with JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP images
2. **Invalid Files**: Test with PDFs, text files, videos
3. **Size Limits**: Test files over 10MB
4. **Corrupted Files**: Test empty or damaged image files

### S3 Upload Testing
1. **Configuration**:
   - Enter valid AWS credentials
   - Test with invalid credentials
   - Test with non-existent bucket
2. **Upload Process**:
   - Verify progress indicator
   - Check success messages
   - Validate file appears in S3 bucket
   - Confirm metadata is attached

### Mobile Testing

- ✅ Bucket not found → Specific guidance
- ✅ Access denied → Permission advice
- ✅ Upload timeout → Retry mechanism (3 attempts)
- ✅ Large file handling → Progress tracking

### Camera Errors
- ✅ Permission denied → Clear instructions
- ✅ Camera not found → Fallback message
- ✅ Camera in use → Alternative suggestion
- ✅ Unsupported browser → Feature detection

### File Handling Errors
- ✅ Invalid file type → Supported formats list
- ✅ File too large → Size limit information
- ✅ Corrupted files → Integrity checking
- ✅ Loading failures → User-friendly messages

## 📊 Performance Validation

### Image Processing
- ✅ JPEG compression (0.8 quality)
- ✅ Canvas memory cleanup
- ✅ Blob URL revocation
- ✅ Stream resource cleanup

### Memory Management

- ✅ Large file handling without crashes
- ✅ Multiple capture sessions supported
- ✅ Browser resource cleanup on unload

## ✅ Testing Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] All test suites pass
- [ ] Camera functionality works on target devices
- [ ] File uploads work with test images
- [ ] S3 configuration and upload successful
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness validated
- [ ] Error scenarios handled gracefully
- [ ] Performance acceptable on target devices

### Production Readiness
- [ ] HTTPS configured for camera access
- [ ] S3 bucket CORS policy configured
- [ ] IAM permissions properly scoped
- [ ] Error monitoring setup
- [ ] User analytics (optional)
- [ ] Content Security Policy (CSP)

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Security Considerations
- AWS credentials stored in localStorage (client-side)
- No server-side validation
- Suitable for trusted environments only
- Consider server-side proxy for production

### Browser Compatibility
- Camera requires HTTPS (except localhost)
- Safari may need user interaction for getUserMedia
- File API limited in older browsers
- Service Workers not supported in IE

### Performance Notes
- Large images may cause memory issues
- Network speed affects upload time
- Multiple concurrent uploads not supported
- No resume capability for failed uploads

## 🚀 Deployment Recommendations

### Development
- Use localhost with HTTP for testing
- Enable browser developer tools
- Test with multiple browsers
- Validate on actual mobile devices

### Production
- Deploy with HTTPS certificate
- Configure proper CORS policies
- Set up error monitoring
- Implement proper logging
- Consider CDN for AWS SDK
- Add service worker for offline support

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Camera not working**: Check HTTPS, permissions, browser compatibility
2. **File upload fails**: Verify file type, size, and format
3. **S3 upload errors**: Check credentials, bucket existence, CORS policy
4. **Mobile UI issues**: Test viewport meta tag, CSS media queries
5. **Performance problems**: Monitor memory usage, image sizes

### Debug Tools
- Browser Developer Console
- Network tab for upload monitoring
- Application tab for localStorage inspection
- Device toolbar for mobile simulation
- Lighthouse for performance analysis
